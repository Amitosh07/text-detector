Page 23: In SQL, we can use the same name for two (or more) attributes as long
Page 23: as the attributes are in different relations
Page 24: as Alias. The use of table aliases is to rename a table in a specific SQL statement.
Page 24: The renaming is a temporary change and the actual table name does not change in
Page 27: In this case, aliases are given to the relation name

Page 27: ◦In Q8, the alternate relation names E and S are called aliases or tuple variables for

Page 43: In general, we can have several levels of nested queries
Page 44: If a condition in the WHERE-clause of a nested query references an attribute of a

Page 63: CTE (Common Table Expressions)
Page 63: Every query generates a temporary result or relation. In order to give a name to
Page 63: those temporary result set, CTE is used.
Page 63: A CTE is defined using WITH clause.
Page 63: Using WITH clause we can define more than one CTEs in a single statement.
Page 63: A CTE can be referenced in the other CTEs that are part of same WITH clause
Page 63: The scope of every CTE exist within the statement in which it is defined.
